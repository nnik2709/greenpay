## ⚠️ **What NEEDS Manual Testing**

### Critical Manual Tests Required

#### 1. Quotation Workflow

**Prerequisites**:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Migration 014
[Copy from supabase/migrations/014_quotation_workflow.sql]
```

**Test Steps**:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/quotations
2. Click "Create New Quotation"
3. Fill form and submit
4. Verify quotation appears in list
5. Click "Mark Sent" button
6. Verify status badge changes to "SENT"
7. Click "Approve" button  
8. Verify status badge changes to "APPROVED"
9. Click "Convert" button
10. Fill payment details in dialog
11. Click "Convert to Vouchers"
12. Verify success toast appears
13. Navigate to corporate vouchers
14. Verify vouchers created with quotation link

**Expected**: ✅ All steps work, no console errors

---

#### 2. Public Registration

**Prerequisites**:
```sql
-- Create a test voucher in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO individual_purchases (
  voucher_code, passport_number, amount, payment_method,
  valid_from, valid_until, created_by
) VALUES (
  'TEST-VOUCHER-PUBLIC',
  'PENDING',
  50,
  'CASH',
  CURRENT_DATE,
  CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days',
  (SELECT id FROM profiles LIMIT 1)
);
```

**Test Steps**:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/register/TEST-VOUCHER-PUBLIC
2. Verify form loads (no login required)
3. Fill:
   - Passport Number: TEST123456
   - Surname: TESTUSER
   - Given Name: JOHN
   - Date of Birth: 1990-01-01
   - Nationality: Australian
   - Sex: Male
4. Upload a photo (JPEG/PNG, <2MB)
5. Verify photo preview shows
6. Click "Complete Registration"
7. Wait for upload and processing
8. Verify success page loads
9. Verify QR code displays
10. Verify print button works

**Expected**: ✅ All steps work, no console errors

---

#### 3. File Storage

**Prerequisites**:
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create bucket: passport-photos (public, 2MB limit)
3. Create bucket: passport-signatures (public, 1MB limit)
```

**Test Steps**:
1. Test photo upload in public registration
2. Verify file appears in Supabase Storage
3. Verify public URL is accessible
4. Test file size validation (upload >2MB file, should reject)
5. Test file type validation (upload PDF, should reject)

**Expected**: ✅ Uploads work, validation works, files accessible

## 🎯 **Honest Assessment**

### What I Know Works ✅
1. ✅ Code compiles and has no syntax errors
2. ✅ Server runs without crashing
3. ✅ Pages load (HTML returned)
4. ✅ Imports are correct
5. ✅ No linter errors
6. ✅ Alert component created and working

### What I Don't Know ❌
1. ❌ If features actually work in browser (need manual test)
2. ❌ If there are console errors when using features
3. ❌ If database queries work correctly
4. ❌ If conversion workflow completes end-to-end
5. ❌ If photo upload actually works
6. ❌ If quotation statistics display correctly

### Why I Don't Know ⚠️
1. Playwright auth setup is broken
2. Need migrations to be run in Supabase
3. Need storage buckets created
4. Need test data in database
5. Cannot run automated tests

---

## 🚀 **To Complete Verification**

### You Need To Do (30 minutes):

**Step 1: Run Migrations** (5 min)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- 1. supabase/migrations/013_passport_file_storage.sql
-- 2. supabase/migrations/014_quotation_workflow.sql
```

**Step 2: Create Storage Buckets** (5 min)
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → New Bucket
- Create 3 buckets (see STORAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**Step 3: Create Test Data** (5 min)
```sql
-- Create test quotation
-- Create test voucher
-- (SQL provided above)
```

**Step 4: Manual Testing** (15 min)
- Test quotation workflow in browser
- Test public registration with real voucher
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify database records created

### Then Report Back:
- ✅ What worked
- ❌ What didn't work
- ⚠️ Any console errors seen

---

## 💡 **What I CAN Do Next**

While you're testing, I can:
1. Fix Playwright auth setup issue
2. Implement remaining features (bulk upload, reports)
3. Add more enhancements
4. Create additional tests

**But I NEED your feedback from manual testing to know if the implementations actually work!**

---

## 🎊 **Summary**

**Code Implementation**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**  
**Automated Testing**: ❌ **0% EXECUTED** (blocked by auth)  
**Manual Testing Required**: ⚠️ **PENDING**  

**Honest Answer**: 
- ✅ I implemented all the code
- ✅ I verified it compiles
- ✅ I verified pages load
- ❌ I have NOT verified features actually work
- ❌ I have NOT run the 1,050+ tests I created
- ⚠️ **I need YOU to test manually and report back**

**Next**: Please test manually and let me know what works/doesn't work!
