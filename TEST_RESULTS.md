**Passed**: 3 ✅
**Failed**: 10 ❌
**Success Rate**: 23%

## ✅ Passed Tests (3)

### Supabase Connection Tests
1. **should connect to Supabase successfully** - Verified Supabase client initialization
2. **should not have RLS policy errors** - Confirmed no infinite recursion errors
3. **should load login page** - Login page renders correctly with email/password fields

---

## ❌ Failed Tests (10)

All failures are related to **authentication not completing**. The login form fills correctly but doesn't navigate after clicking "Sign In".

### Authentication Tests (5 failures)
- should login as admin successfully
- should login as finance manager
- should login as counter agent
- should login as IT support
- should reject invalid credentials

**Error**: `TimeoutError: page.waitForURL: Timeout 10000ms exceeded`
**Cause**: Page stays on login screen, doesn't navigate to dashboard

### Sample Data Tests (5 failures)
All fail during the login step (same error as above):
- should display passports from sample data
- should display quotations
- should display reports
- should display users (admin only)
- should display payment modes

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The test failures are caused by **test users not existing in Supabase Auth**.

### What's Missing:

1. **Users in Supabase Auth Dashboard**:
   - The SQL scripts (`complete-setup.sql`) only create **profiles** linked to existing auth users
   - The actual auth users must be created manually in Supabase Dashboard first
   - Test users needed:
     - admin@example.com (password: admin123)
     - finance@example.com (password: finance123)
     - agent@example.com (password: agent123)
     - support@example.com (password: support123)

2. **Profile Setup**:
   - After creating users in Supabase Auth, run `complete-setup.sql` to create their profiles with roles

---

## Next Steps to Fix Tests

### Step 1: Create Auth Users in Supabase

Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Add User (via email)

Create these 4 users:

```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
Email Confirmation: Enabled (or disable email confirmation in Auth settings)
```

```
Email: finance@example.com
Password: finance123
Email Confirmation: Enabled
```

```
Email: agent@example.com
Password: agent123
Email Confirmation: Enabled
```

```
Email: support@example.com
Password: support123
Email Confirmation: Enabled
```

**Important**: If email confirmation is required, you'll need to either:
- Disable email confirmation in Supabase Auth settings, OR
- Manually confirm each user in the dashboard after creation

### Step 2: Run Profile Setup Script

After creating the auth users, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# File: complete-setup.sql
# This links the auth users to profiles with correct roles
```

### Step 3: Add Sample Data

Run the sample data script:

```bash
# File: sample-data.sql
# This adds test passports, quotations, vouchers, etc.
```

### Step 4: Re-run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

All 13 tests should pass once users are properly set up.

## Alternative: Quick Manual Test

Before re-running automated tests, manually verify:

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Try logging in with: admin@example.com / admin123
4. Should redirect to dashboard
5. Check browser console for errors

## Test Configuration

- **Framework**: Playwright 1.55.1
- **Browser**: Chromium (headless)
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:3002 (configured in playwright.config.js)
- **Workers**: 1 (sequential execution to avoid conflicts)
- **Retries**: 0 (local), 2 (CI)

## Status

**Action Required**: Create 4 test users in Supabase Auth dashboard before tests can pass.

Once users are created and profiles are linked (via complete-setup.sql), all tests should pass successfully.
