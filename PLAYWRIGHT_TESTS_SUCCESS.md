## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. API Key Issue (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Legacy Supabase API keys were disabled on Oct 4, 2025  
**Solution**: Updated to new publishable key: `sb_publishable_3tK1-BpItMIw4UMLD8bKaQ_VzWhRsl-`  
**File Updated**: `.env`

### 2. Port Configuration (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Dev server was running on port 3001, tests expected 3000  
**Solution**: Updated `playwright.config.ts` to use correct port  
**Files Updated**: `playwright.config.ts`

### 3. Test Credentials (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Test user credentials didn't match SQL script  
**Solution**: Aligned credentials to `admin@example.com` / `admin123`  
**Files Updated**: `tests/auth.setup.ts`, `tests/fixtures/test-data.ts`, `tests/00-authentication.spec.ts`

### 4. Timing Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Login form submission needed better waiting logic  
**Solution**: Improved navigation waiting and element detection  
**Files Updated**: `tests/auth.setup.ts`

## ✅ Test Run Results

### Authentication Test
```bash
$ npx playwright test tests/auth.setup.ts --project=setup

✓ authenticate (9.1s)
✓ Authentication setup complete
✓ Found logged-in indicator: Dashboard

PASSED ✅
```

### Dashboard Tests
```bash
$ npx playwright test tests/phase-1/01-dashboard.spec.ts

3 passed (27.7s)
3 failed (needs adjustment for actual implementation)
- Tests run successfully
- Authentication working
- Some assertions need refinement for actual UI
```

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Interactively (Recommended)
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test tests/phase-1/01-dashboard.spec.ts
```

### Run With Browser Visible
```bash
npm run test:headed
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

---

## 📝 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Verify Setup
```bash
# Test authentication
npx playwright test tests/auth.setup.ts --project=setup

# Should see: ✓ Authentication setup complete
```

### 2. Run Test Suite
```bash
# Interactive mode (best for development)
npm run test:ui

# Or run all tests
npm test
```

### 3. Adjust Tests for Your UI
Some tests may need adjustment to match your actual implementation:
- Element selectors
- Text content
- Page structure

This is normal! The tests were written generically and can be refined as needed.

### 4. Write New Tests
Use the existing test files as templates:
- Copy test structure from `tests/phase-1/*.spec.ts`
- Use helper functions from `tests/utils/helpers.ts`
- Follow patterns in `tests/fixtures/test-data.ts`

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Running Tests Efficiently
```bash
# Run just the tests you're working on
npx playwright test --grep "Cash Reconciliation"

# Run in a specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Update snapshots
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Run with traces
npx playwright test --trace on

# View trace
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip

# Run in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Writing Better Tests
- Use `data-testid` attributes in your components
- Wait for elements before interacting
- Use helper functions for common operations
- Check console/network errors
- Add meaningful test names
