## üêõ If Still Getting "Not Authenticated"

### Quick Diagnosis:

**1. Check browser console (F12) - What does it say?**

**If you see:** `"Auth check on mount: Not authenticated"`  
**Means:** Not logged in  
**Fix:** Refresh and log in again

**If you see:** `"No session or user found"`  
**Means:** Session issue  
**Fix:** Clear cookies, close browser, reopen, login fresh

**If you see:** `"Session error: ..."`  
**Means:** Supabase connection issue  
**Fix:** Check .env file has correct VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

---

### Detailed Diagnosis:

**Option 1: Use Diagnostic Tool**
```bash
# Open this file in browser
open test-auth.html

# Follow the 4 steps
# It will tell you exactly what's wrong
```

**Option 2: Manual Check**

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
// Check 1: Environment
console.log('URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL);
console.log('Has Key:', !!import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

// Check 2: Session
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
console.log('Logged in:', !!data.session);
console.log('Email:', data.session?.user?.email);

// If both show correct values, it should work!
```
