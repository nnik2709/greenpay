# Supabase Migration Summary

## ✅ Completed

The PNG Green Fees System has been successfully migrated to use Supabase as the backend database.

### What Was Done

1. **Database Schema Created** (`supabase-schema.sql`)
   - 10 production-ready tables with proper relationships
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for role-based access control
   - Indexes for performance optimization
   - Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
   - Helper functions for code generation
   - Database views for reporting

2. **Data Access Layer Built**
   - 8 new service files created for all database operations
   - Clean separation between UI and data access
   - Consistent error handling
   - Transaction support where needed

3. **Authentication Migrated**
   - Updated AuthContext to use Supabase Auth
   - User profiles linked to Supabase Auth users
   - Session management handled automatically

4. **Configuration & Testing**
   - Environment variables configured
   - Connection test utility created
   - Dev server successfully running

5. **Documentation**
   - SUPABASE_SETUP.md - Complete setup guide
   - CLAUDE.md updated with migration details
   - Code comments and inline documentation

## 📋 Next Steps (To Complete Migration)

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get your Supabase credentials:
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project
   - Go to **Settings** > **API**
   - Copy **Project URL** and **anon public** key

3. Update `.env` with your credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   ```

### 2. Run the Database Schema in Supabase

**IMPORTANT:** You must run this before the app will work!

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open `supabase-schema.sql` from this repository
4. Copy the entire file and paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**
6. Verify all tables were created (check for errors)

### 3. Create Your First Admin User

After running the schema:

1. Go to **Authentication** > **Users** in Supabase dashboard
2. Click **Add user** > **Create new user**
3. Email: `admin@example.com` (or your preferred email)
4. Password: Choose a secure password
5. Click **Create user**
6. Copy the user's UUID
7. Go back to **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, role, active)
VALUES (
  'PASTE_UUID_HERE',
  'admin@example.com',
  'Flex_Admin',
  true
);
```

### 4. Test the Application

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the login page
3. Log in with your admin credentials
4. Check browser console for Supabase connection test results

### 5. Update Pages to Use Supabase Services (Optional)

The following pages still use mock data and need to be updated:

**Priority Updates:**
- `src/pages/Passports.jsx` - Use `passportsService.js`
- `src/pages/IndividualPurchase.jsx` - Use `individualPurchasesService.js`
- `src/pages/Users.jsx` - Use `usersService.js`
- `src/pages/Quotations.jsx` - Use `quotationsService.js`

**Already Migrated:**
- ✅ `src/pages/admin/PaymentModes.jsx` - Using `paymentModesStorage.js`
- ✅ `src/pages/Tickets.jsx` - Using `ticketStorage.js`
- ✅ Authentication - Using `AuthContext` with Supabase

See `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on each step.

## 📊 Database Tables

| Table | Purpose | Status |

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- Role-based policies restrict data access
- Users can only see data relevant to their role
- Admins have full access
- Automatic timestamp tracking
- Secure credential storage in environment variables

## 🛠️ Available Service Files

All service files are in `src/lib/`:

```javascript
// Example usage:
import { getPassports, createPassport } from '@/lib/passportsService';
import { createIndividualPurchase, validateVoucher } from '@/lib/individualPurchasesService';
import { getUsers, createUser } from '@/lib/usersService';
// ... etc
```

## 📝 Notes

- Legacy mock data files (`*Data.js`) have been kept for reference
- The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed
- All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub
- The application is ready for Supabase testing once the schema is run

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

Before considering the migration complete, test these features:

- [ ] User login with Supabase Auth
- [ ] Create a passport record
- [ ] Create an individual purchase
- [ ] Create a corporate voucher
- [ ] Generate a quotation

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

For production deployment:

1. Update `.env.production` with Supabase credentials
2. Ensure all RLS policies are properly configured
3. Create production users through Supabase Auth
4. Test all features in production environment
5. Monitor Supabase logs for any issues

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. Verify the schema was run successfully
