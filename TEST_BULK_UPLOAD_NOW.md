## üêõ Debugging Authentication Issues

### Issue: "Not Authenticated" Error

Open browser console (F12) and check which line is failing:

**If you see: "No user found in session"**
```bash
# This means you're not logged in
# Solution: Refresh page and log in again
```

**If you see: "Auth error: ..."**
```bash
# This means Supabase connection issue
# Check:
1. Are VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY set?
2. Is your Supabase project active?
3. Is the network connection working?
```

**If you see: "Database connection not available"**
```bash
# This means Supabase client didn't initialize
# Check .env file exists with correct values
```

### Verify Environment Variables

```bash
# Check if .env file exists
cat .env | grep VITE_SUPABASE

# Should show:
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```

**If .env doesn't exist:**
```bash
# Create it
cp .env.example .env

# Edit and add your Supabase credentials
# Get them from: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
```

### Check if User is Logged In

Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Check authentication
const { data } = await window.supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('Current user:', data.user);

// Should show user object with email
```
