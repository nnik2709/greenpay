## 🔧 **Setup Required for Full Testing**

### Supabase Dashboard (10 minutes)

1. **Create Storage Buckets**:
   ```
   - passport-photos (public, 2MB limit)
   - passport-signatures (public, 1MB limit)
   - voucher-batches (public, 10MB limit)
   ```

2. **Run Migration 013** (File Storage):
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy from: `supabase/migrations/013_passport_file_storage.sql`
   - Paste and Run

3. **Run Migration 014** (Quotation Workflow):
   - Copy from: `supabase/migrations/014_quotation_workflow.sql`
   - Paste and Run

4. **Create Test Quotation** (for testing workflow):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO quotations (
     quotation_number, company_name, contact_person, contact_email,
     number_of_passports, amount_per_passport, total_amount,
     valid_until, status, created_by
   ) VALUES (
     'QUO-TEST-001', 'Test Company', 'John Manager', 'test@example.com',
     5, 50, 250,
     CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days', 'pending',
     (SELECT id FROM profiles LIMIT 1)
   );
   ```

## 🧪 **Test Execution Plan**

### After Setup is Complete

#### Test 1: Quotation Workflow
```bash
# Manual browser test:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/quotations
2. See test quotation in list
3. Click "Mark Sent" - verify status changes
4. Click "Approve" - verify status changes
5. Click "Convert" - dialog opens
6. Fill payment details
7. Click "Convert to Vouchers"
8. Verify success toast
9. Check corporate_vouchers table has new vouchers
```

#### Test 2: Public Registration
```bash
# Create test voucher first, then:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/register/VCH-CODE
2. Fill all form fields
3. Upload a test photo
4. Click "Complete Registration"
5. Verify success page shows
6. Check passports table updated
7. Check voucher linked to passport
```

#### Test 3: Playwright Automated Tests
```bash
# Once auth is fixed:
npx playwright test tests/new-features/ --project=chromium
npx playwright test tests/regression/ --project=chromium
```
